## Structure:

* `server.js` contains the implementation of the server
    * Json API is available via `/api/...` routes.
    * Routes for the web application:
        * `/` is the home page.
        * `/timeline/:userName` shows the timeline of the given user.
* The `app` folder contains the javascript app.
    * `main.jsx` is the entry point.
    * `components/app.jsx` is where the client-side routes are defined.

## Tutorial

There's an incomplete application in the `tutorial` branch, that you can
complete by adding the backend pieces to talk to Antidote.
